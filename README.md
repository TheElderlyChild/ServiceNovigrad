Don't run on a screen smaller than that of "Nexus 5".

Currently, the project is implemented with RelativeLayouts which do not adapt to screen size
Deliverable 4 will be implemented with ConstraintLayouts which can adapt.

Elliot Kirsch and Shinlong Chen are currently not members of this group.
Current Members are: Wyse Ebbah, Kian Mozefarian.

Delay in Submission of Deliverable 2/3 is due to the restructure of the group, as members
left close to the deadline without contibuting.
